* Uses United States Social Security Administration (SSA) data publicly available via their official website [linked here](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html)
* Per the SSA, "All names are from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States." - i.e. births only (doesn't include data from immigrants or adult name-changers)
* SSA provides only the top 1000 names for each year, which account for ~75% of recorded births, so this tool can't display trends for the remaining ~25% rarest names.
